Are you looking for a programmatically accurate document to guide you through your specific configuration needs?
 
Also, simulate a use case to test-drive, even before actual deployments? 
 
That enables you to perform your task effortlessly and provides a seamless experience between the written word and the actual deployment? 
 
You've come to the right place!

Cisco 8000 Emulator Notebooks provide a real-time configuration experienceâ€” where you can simulate and configure the device as you read through the text and view the output instantly.

 
Read on to know more!

## What are Cisco 8000 Emulator Notebooks?
The Cisco 8000 Emulator Notebooks are live documents that combine narrative text, images, videos, runnable code, and real-time outputs. 
 
These notebooks are created using Jupyter, an open source software.

## How do these Notebooks work for me?
The Notebook communicates with the Cisco 8000 emulator running in the background and brings up multi-router topologies within minutes at the click of the play button. You can then execute commands and configurations on the emulated routers directly from the Notebook.

## Why Notebooks?
The PyVxr API, when invoked from within Notebooks, allows you to build and manage virtual multi-router topologies within minutes.
 
The PyVxr API sends your configurations to the virtual routers and retrieves real-time status in the same document. You can read the content, run, customize, and experiment with configurations based on your business needs.

## What are the Benefits?
* Automates the creation and bringing-up of the topology on the Cisco 8000 Emulator, and saves time.
* Provides flexibility to customize topology by adding and modifying CLIs.
* Enables test proof-of-concept, use cases, or features to existing problems.
* Doubles up as a tutorial to educate customers or partners.
* Allows use case simulation and testing before actual deployments
